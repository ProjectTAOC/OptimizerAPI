# Trading Algorithm Optimizer

This is the Trading Algorithm Optimization Source Code.  This currently contains all of the source code for both the logic and the front end until we isolate the business logic library and extract it from the views.

## Installation

There are a few different ways this application can be installed:

### 1) Source code installation
The easiest way to get this code running is to check out the repo from git and drop it directly into the web2py applications folder.

Once this is done then the application will need to be configured in the web2py admin screens.

### 2) Source Code Symlink
The source code for this project can also exist as a symlink from the web2py applications directory to this source code existing in another location.

In order to do this, the repo should be checked out just as above but instead of moving the source code into the applications directory a symlink to the folder should be created.  Then the application should be configured in the web2py admin screen just as above.

### 2) w2p installation
The third option for the installation of this application is to obtain a w2p application artifact which should then be placed inside of the applications directory as mentioned above.

## Usage

This is currently a web based application which has no special requirements for usage.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

This software has originally been created from the web2py welcome application just as an example to get things started.  We should expect that this entire application will eventually be stripped back down to only the code we have written with none of the original code left in place.

## Credits

All credit for the original web2py welcome application app should be given to the web2py creators.  All further and additional versions of this code should be then accredited to Thomas Oliver, Gerik Peterson, and any other subsidiary support.
